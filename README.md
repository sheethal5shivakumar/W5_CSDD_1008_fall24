This project involves building a RESTful API in Go to manage a collection of tasks, with each task containing a title, description, and status ("pending" or "completed"). The API will allow users to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on tasks.

Key functionalities include:

Create a new task (POST /tasks).

Read all tasks or a single task by its ID (GET /tasks and GET /tasks/{id}).

Update an existing task's details (PUT /tasks/{id}).

Delete a task by its ID (DELETE /tasks/{id}).
